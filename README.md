# chip-weatherstation
Small project involving NTC C.H.I.P. and a BMP180.

## Building libbmp180

Before it can be used, the library must be built. Run `make` from within the `libbmp180` directory.
A sample test implementation is provided in test.c. Build it by running `make` from the top-level directory (after building libbmp180 first).
